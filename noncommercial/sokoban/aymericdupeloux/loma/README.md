The LOMA collection (Levels Of Many Authors) was started in 2004 and can be published freely everywhere without requiring the author's permission.

In Feb 2021, this sokoban collection contains 137 LOMA levels. 

It can always increase if some authors take up the challenge (not necessary 10 levels) !

The challenge is to create some levels by respecting some rules :

- Each level must have only 3 boxes and less than 40 spaces inside the walls

- All boxes must be moved and the "best pushes" must be greater than 6 

- Try to create a complete set of 10 levels by using each one of the 10 patterns below (no sokoban on target) :

Thank you very much to the authors who took up the challenge : Fran√ßois Marques (10) , David Skinner (30 !), Sven Egevad (10), Victor Kindermans (10), Michael Steins (10), Frantisek Pokorny (10), Arpad Fekete (10), Roger Delaporte (10), Jordi Domenech (6), Jorge Gloria (10), Marti Homs (10)  and your sokofan servant (11).
