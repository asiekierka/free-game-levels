The easiest collection, created in 2001. It is inspired from the collection Microcosmos and Nabokosmos. I created it for beginners who never played Sokoban before. This collection contains some twin levels which allow you to learn progressively this game  by adding a box. An expert should solve it in less than one hour. 

This collection contains 40 levels :  2 levels "1box", 16 levels "2boxes" and 22 levels "3boxes".
