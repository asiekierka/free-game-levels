This collection has been released in 6 months (2001). It was published progressively on the site of Paul Voyer, Gerald Holler and Frantisek Pokorny.  I wanted this collection to be more difficult than Microcosmos, but still with small levels.  And why Nabokosmos ? Read backwards "Som(e)sokoban" ;-Â° 

This collection contains 40 levels : 2 levels "3boxes", 8 levels "4boxes", 21 levels "5boxes",  7 levels "6boxes" and 2 levels "7boxes".
