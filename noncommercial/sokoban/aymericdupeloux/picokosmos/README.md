Here is the hardest Cosmos collection (2001). It's the logical continuation of the collections Minicosmos-Microcosmos-Nabokosmos (It sounds like Milli-Micro-Nano-Pico !). It's intented to the fanatics of Sokoban.

This collection contains 20 levels : 3 levels "6boxes",  7 levels "7boxes" and 10 levels "8boxes".
