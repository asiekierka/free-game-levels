# The Warehouse Volume I - Vertical Mobility

Here is a set of fifty Sokoban levels I created in the spring of 2009.  These levels are copyrighted by myself but can be copied freely as long as the copyright is retained.

I was inspired by the work of Aymeric du Peloux, specifically the Microcosmos and Nabokosmos level-sets as well as the LOMA project. I became interested in writing my own levels and I wanted to write levels that are like Aymeric's levels:

 * elegant
 * compact
 * attractive
 * fewer boxes is better
 * all boxes move
 * deceptively hard
 * but not too hard

I included in this set of fifty levels my version of the ten  LOMA levels Aymeric designed. In the spirit of LOMA, I also created several 4, 5, and 6 box designs inspired by the 3-box LOMA designs. I came to appreciate the 3-box level much more after this exercise.  The subtitle of this level-set "Vertical Mobility" is a reference to the fact that all of the levels are taller than they are wide, and with sizes chosen so that they can be played  on a display with the size and aspect ratio of a typical mobile phone without rotation.

I would like to dedicate this level-set to Aymeric du Peloux for inspiration, to lotecsoftware.com who provided the Sokoban player for my mobile phone, and to my family for supporting my projects.

If you don't know what Sokoban is, or how to use this Sokoban file, I would recommend starting at The Sokoban Project.

Anyway, here is the level-set in text file format that can be imported into most Sokoban players: Warehouse-Volume-I.txt (right-click to save the file to your computer).

Have fun!
