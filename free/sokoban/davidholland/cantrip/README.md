# The cantrip Sokoban levels by David Holland

original release date: September 2001.

Author's note: The puzzles are all small (between 6 and 9 goals and pretty cramped), with maze and walls designed by me and computer-generated start positions. Because of the computer involvement, the start positions of the puzzles may look abstract or random. The meat of the puzzles is in the variations, the unexpected twists, and the underlying problems. The human element of design is most evident in the solved position, by construction, and I like to think of the solving process as producing order from chaos. This collection is meant for experienced solvers, or at least determined ones, as it contains probably my toughest puzzles so far. As usual I have tried to put the puzzles in rough ascending order of difficulty, but here this is even more approximate than usual as I find the puzzles difficult to compare. The puzzles have been extensively play-tested. On a good day I can actually solve them...
