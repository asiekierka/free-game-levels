# The dh2 Sokoban levels by David Holland

Original release date: June 2001.

Author's note: There are no computer-generated levels as I am trying to evolve a puzzle-making style, and so experimenting with as many different forms as possible. Some of the puzzles are very, or slightly, symmetrical as a stylistic device (in this I am influenced by David W. Skinner's excellent Sasquatch puzzle sets at his Sokoban page). Others are completely unsymmetrical and the style is in the variations alone.
