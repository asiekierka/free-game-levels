# The bagatelle Sokoban levels by David Holland

original release date: October 2001

Bagatelle is a French word for a trinket, from the Italian for a conjuror's trick. The collection contains fairly simple puzzles (of less difficulty than my previous collection maelstrom) of various sizes. Some of the small puzzles are easier versions of puzzles in my other collections. Others are my take on some classical Sokoban themes (goals in a line, in a cross shape, objects outside goal room for tricky start and finish). The problems posed by each puzzle are of a fairly straightforward kind, but are nevertheless quite varied. The puzzles are in roughly ascending order of difficulty.
