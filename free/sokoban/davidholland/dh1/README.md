# The dh1 Sokoban levels by David Holland

original release date: October 2000

Author's note: I have experimented with computer-generation for several of the smaller puzzles hence the "co-authorship" with sokgen (a computer program of mine). If you like the puzzles email me and if you have stylistic criticisms direct them to sokgen :-)

For those interested in the programming: sokgen uses exhaustive search of a puzzle space (backwards from a solved position). This can only be achieved for (very) small puzzles (about 100,000 "nodes" is the limit for my computer system, where a "node" represents a single legal push and movements of the man are not represented for brevity) . For the co-authored puzzles, I designed the maze and placed the goals, and sokgen generated start positions of stones and (usually) push-minimal solutions at the largest push-depth possible.
