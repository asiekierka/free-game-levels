
  This collection of Sokoban puzzles was generated by the SokEvo
  program written by Lee J Haywood, which used random numbers to
  'evolve' them.

  The puzzles start off very easy, with just one box push required to
  solve the first 2 puzzles, then two pushes for the second pair of
  puzzles, and so on for increasing whole numbers of pushes.  The
  puzzles become difficult surprisingly quickly.

  It is intended that the puzzles are played from the beginning, with
  increasing 'levels' of difficulty.  This collection has new puzzles
  added gradually, and there is an RSS feed for it so that you can
  easily check for new updates.

  The title of this collection relates to the use of the term
  'whole number' to mean the positive integers, 1, 2, 3, ... which are
  used for each pair of puzzles to limit the number of box pushes
  required to solve them.  The two puzzles in each pair have been
  frivolously labelled L and R for 'left' and 'right'.
