
  This collection of Sokoban puzzle designs was generated by a program
  written by Lee J Haywood that used random numbers and a solving
  program to 'evolve' them.

  Check http://www.deth.dsl.pipex.com/sokoban.html for new releases.
  This collection has a version number and new designs get added
  occasionally.

  Try each design in file name order - a prefix approximately sorts
  them by the length of their shortest solutions, which is intended to
  be an objective way of ordering them from easiest to hardest.  Your
  abilities are likely to mean that some seem to be out of place,
  however.  Also, some designs have more solutions than others so may
  be easier as a result.  The later designs are extremely difficult.

  Each design has been assigned a name at random, but where designs
  share the same surname they are from the same 'family' and may have
  similar features.  No resemblance to actual persons, living or dead,
  is intended.
