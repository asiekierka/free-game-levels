
  This collection of Sokoban puzzles was generated by a program
  written by Lee J Haywood that used random numbers and Brian
  Damgaard's YASGen program to 'evolve' them.

  Check http://fruise.googlepages.com/sokoban.html for new releases.
  This collection has a version number and new puzzles get added
  occasionally.

  These puzzles are in release/creation order.  Check the website for
  a score table that roughly indicates the difficulty for each puzzle.

  Each puzzle has been assigned a name at random, but where puzzles
  share the same surname they are from the same 'family' and may have
  similar features.  No resemblance to actual persons, living or dead,
  is intended.
